    <h1>Data Description</h1>

    <p>The hottest topic in recent times and the topic most relevant to us is cornavirus.Originally we planned to choose this topic in the last project, but  finally we chose the  youtube trend topic because we were worried that there may were many groups chose cornavirus. This time, With the increase in the number of cornavirus infections and the gradual increase in mortality, we finally decide to use this topic for it's really valuable and worth analyzing. We want to analyze some basic characteristics of cornavirus, including the susceptible crowd and the speed of propagation.In order to achieve better results in the analysis, we narrowed the scope and selected the United States as the target of the analysis.</p>
    <p>To achieve this, we have currently selected two data sets. The first dataseet is the john hopkins's 2019 cornavirus dataset.This data set is in units of days. the csv files' name 's format is day- monthe -year.csv.   One reason for choosing this dataset is that we can easily use it to draw a time trend chart. of cornavirus This dataset has these following attributes:FIPS Federal Information Processing Standards code. It It implicitly pointed out the corresponding county name.   Admin2: this attributes shows the county name like fairfax , Province_State,the value of this attributes are  DC, Virginia, and so on.Country_Region, for example, us china, india. We use this attribute to divide the US data we need from ther others.Last Update, we don't use it for We only need the daily data, and there is no requirement for accurate hourly data.Lat and Long, we can use it to locate the county and draw our map chart.Confirmed£¨Deaths£¨Recovered:these 3 attribute shows Confirmed ,death and revocered cases in each county.Confirmed and death cases's number are accurate, and the revovered cases's number is just an estimate. We will use this data vary carefully.the Active and the combine key attributes are just combines of attributes before. This is the first dataset.This data set provides us with an entry point for macro analysis of cornavirys.Day by day , from county to country.</p>
    <p>In order to more specifically analyze the impact of cornavirus on different populations, we chose the  "Cases of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in the U.S." dataset from cdc.gov.It shows the Demographic characteristics of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.Different age groups smaller than 18, 18 - 44  and so on, different races:like asian,black or afican american.We choose this dataset for we want to know if cornavirus is a more contagious disease than atypical pneumonia and H1N.These two diseases only infects in special districts.Atypical pneumonia in china and h1n1 in us.</p>
    <p>After completing the work currently planned, if there is enough time , we can further analyze the data of cornavirus transmission trends worldwide.the global data is included in the Hopkins data set. We can also divide the crowd in different way, not limited to different races.For example the sex, female and male.But to acheive this we need another dataset.Yeah, we design to draw a sex bart chart but the dataset in fact doesn't include sex information. We need another dataset.</p>
